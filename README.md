# reducer-demo
Demo of React Hooks especially the useReducer function

To run, install parcel globally:
```
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```
And run parcel
```
parcel index.html
```

To learn more about how to build the app step-by-step, check [my blog post or tutorial](https://vijayt.com/post/good-bye-redux-global-state-using-react-hooks-and-usereducer-function/)

In my blogpost, I left out the last part or probably the most important part why Redux was not needed. I continued on with this example in [another repository](https://github.com/vijayst/useStore). I called the repo - useStore thinking I will have to write another hook. But apparently what was needed was a StoreContext and a Store component. Check out the source code in the repo on how it works. I probably will write another blog post when I have the time. Thanks.
